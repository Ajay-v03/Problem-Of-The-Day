    "Given a Linked List Representation of Complete Binary Tree. Your task is to construct the Binary tree from the given linkedlist and return the root of the tree.\n",

    "Note: The complete binary tree is represented as a linked list in a way where if the root node is stored at position i, its left, and right children are stored at position 2*i+1, and 2*i+2 respectively. H is the height of the tree and this space is used implicitly for the recursion stack.\n",
