    "The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k.\n",

    "You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.\n",

    "The number abovei should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number belowi appears for all i from 0 to n - 1.\n",

    "- Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.\n",
